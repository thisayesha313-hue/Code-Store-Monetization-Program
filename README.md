* **GitHub Integration:** Simply link your repo; we handle the hosting, ad placements, and scaling.
* **SEO Magic:** Our platform automatically optimizes your App Titles for Google Search, driving organic traffic to your code without you spending a dime on ads.
* **Global & Local Payouts:** We support **bKash** (for local developers), **Wire Transfer**, and **Crypto USDT (BSC)**.

## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. Connect Your Repository
Submit your public GitHub repository URL or upload your web app files through our [Submission Portal](https://www.codestorez.com/user_submit_app.php).

### 2. Automatic Monetization
Our system wraps your code in a high-performance environment with optimized ad placements. We use your repository's title and description to build an SEO-friendly landing page.

### 3. Track & Withdraw
Monitor your "Accumulating Earnings" in real-time. On the 1st of every month, funds move to your "Cleared Balance." Once you hit **$100**, we trigger an automatic payout to your saved method.
